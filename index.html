    <h1>Living to Learn, Learning to Live</h1>
    <h3>In the beginning</h3>
    <p>
      I have started out wondering exactly what my pourpose is in life. I never
      really knew what to expect. And because of that I never made plans. I did
      have ideas, and that is because when plans fail, ideas evolve.
    </p>
    <h4>When the going got tough</h4>
    <p>
      There were times in my life that I wasnt sure if I was going to make it
      beyond whatever was going on.
      <br />
      <br />
      It didnt matter if I went left or right.
      <br />
      <br />
      I could see that the paths were going to be hard. And they were going to
      challenge me beyond anything I have done before.
    </p>
    <h5>To go boldly into life</h5>
    <p>
      At this point I will continue this adventure called life. And I will
      succeed in whatever I do with it. There is nothing that can stop me. There
      is nothing that will stop me. I am T.
